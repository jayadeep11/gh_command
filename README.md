# gh_command

## Description

gh is a simple Bash script to quickly navigate to specific GitHub URLs using the Brave browser by passing simple keys.

## Installation

#### Arch Linux

To make the gh command available as a normal command, you can copy the gh binary to a directory in your system's PATH
<br>
such as /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.
<br>

However, it is generally recommended to use /usr/local/bin for user-installed binaries to **avoid potential conflicts** with system-managed binaries.

```bash
sudo cp gh /usr/local/bin/
```
