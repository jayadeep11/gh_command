# gh_command

## Description

gh is a simple Bash script to quickly navigate to specific GitHub URLs using the Brave browser by passing simple keys.

## Installation

#### Arch Linux


To make the gh command available as a normal command, you can copy the gh binary to a directory in your system's PATH
<br>
such as /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.
<br>

However, it is generally recommended to use /usr/local/bin for user-installed binaries to **avoid potential conflicts** with system-managed binaries.

### To install and run the script, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayadeep11/gh_command.git
cd gh_command
```
2. Run the Script:

```
./install.sh
```


> Now you can use gh as normal command
